### MEDIA TRANSCRIBER APP

This project features a full-stack AI-powered study assistant with a React frontend and Flask backend. The frontend allows users to upload audio or video files, interact with an AI chatbot, view transcript summaries, and generate flashcards, all within a clean, responsive interface styled using TailwindCSS and animated with Framer Motion. The backend handles file uploads, sends audio to OpenAI’s Whisper API for transcription, and uses OpenAI and Together.ai LLMs to process and return summaries, flashcards, and answers. It’s structured around multiple endpoints (`/upload`, `/summarise`, `/flashcards`, `/chatbot`) to keep logic modular and easy to scale.

Follow the setup instructions in the backend and frontend separately(MD files included in each) to run the project.
